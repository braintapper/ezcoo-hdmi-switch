Script to control an Ezcoo HDMI Matrix 4x2 switch (https://www.easycoolav.com/products/hdmi-matrix-4x2-matrix-4-in-2-out-18gbps-mx42hs) using the USB port.

Has only been tested on this model switch, because that's what I have. It may or may not work with other switches depending on the serial port commands.


## Prerequisites
